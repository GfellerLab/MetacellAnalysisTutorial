[//]: # (GRN for metacells)

Gene correlation analysis suffers from large dropout rate of single-cell data and at the same time is very time and memory demanding. Metacells simultaneously adress both issues and thus are beneficial for gene co-expression and gene regulation analysis. Here we demonstrate usage of metacells for GRN analysis using SCENIC [ref].
