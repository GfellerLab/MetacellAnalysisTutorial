One of the features of metacells are their size, which is a number of single cell it contains. Since metacells aggregate different number of cells, they also carry different amount of information. And thus, to better reproduce single-cell analysis, bigger metacells should have larger impact on the results than smaller metacells. For this, a sample-weighted analysis can be applied. Sample-weighted analysis is impleented in the SuperCell package.
