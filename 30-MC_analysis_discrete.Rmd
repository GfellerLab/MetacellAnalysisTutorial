# Downstream analysis of metacells {#downstream-analysis}

In this chapter, we run standard and advanced downstream analyses on metacells instead of single-cell data. 
In this analysis, we treat each metacell as a single cell, neglecting information about the size of the metacell (i.e., number of containing single cells). 
If you are interested in sample-weighted analysis, where metacell size is taken into account, see section \@ref(weighted-analysis).
