# Integration of metacells {#integration}

In this section, we will work with the Human Cell Lung Atlas core [HLCA](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02327-2)
gathering around 580,000 cells from 107 individuals distributed in 166 samples.

The aim of this tutorial is to show how you can use metacells to analyze a very large dataset using a reasonable amount of time and memory.
For this we will use here **SuperCell** via the **MCAT** command line tool.
