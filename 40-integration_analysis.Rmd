# Integration of metacells {#integration}

In this section, we will work with the Human Cell Lung Atlas core [HLCA](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02327-2)
gathering around 580,000 cells from 107 individuals distributed in 166 samples.

The aim of this tutorial is to show how you can use metacells to analyze a very large dataset using a reasonable amount of time and memory.
For this we will use here **SuperCell** via the **MCAT** command line tool.

We will first perform the integration in an unsupervised mode (\@ref(integration-unsupervised)), i.e., without considering the single-cell annotation. Then, we demonstrate supervised integration (\@ref(integration-supervised)).

## Unsupervised integration {#integration-unsupervised}

## Supervised integration {#integration-supervised}
```{r, child='./sub_pages/40-integration_supervised.Rmd'}
```
