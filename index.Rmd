# This tutorial{.unnumbered}

In this tutorial, we describe the different steps that should be followed to build metacells[@baran_metacell_2019] from single-cell data using three frameworks:
SuperCell[@SuperCell] (tutorial in \@ref(SuperCell-construction)), (ii) Metacells version 2 (MC2[@MC2]) (tutorial in \@ref(MC2-construction)), and (iii) SEACells[@SEACells] (tutorial in \@ref(SEACells-construction)).

We also show how to obtain metacells by running these methods using a command line tool that we provide as part of the MetacellAnalysisToolkit (MCAT) [github repository](https://github.com/GfellerLab/MetacellAnalysisToolkit).
This repository also contains the MetacellAnalysisToolkit R package which provides R functions to compute QC
metrics and visualization functions to evaluate the quality of metacells.
In chapter \@ref(XXX), we use MCAT to build metacells on a continuous dataset of CD34+ cells and use the R package to visualize the constructed metacells.
In chapter \@ref(QCs), we describe how to use the R package to evaluate the quality of the metacells.

Finally, we provide examples of downstream analyses performed at the metacell level. These analyses include clustering, differential analysis, data integration and gene regulatory network analysis.
