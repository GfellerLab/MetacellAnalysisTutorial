# Downstream analysis of metacells (for a discrete dataset)

Here we use the obtained metacell to run the downstream analysis on them instead of single-cell data. In this analysis, we treat metacell as single cell, neglecting information about their size (i.e., number of containing single cells). If you are interested in sample-weighted analysis, where metacell size is taken into account, see section \@ref(weighted-analysis).

## Standard analysis (R)
Standard analysis includes dimensionality reduction, clustering, differential expression etc using Seurat [ref] framework.
